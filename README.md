# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
Hello! This is a repository for my Applied Data Science Capstone Project. 

############

Quick Overview
The main objective of this project is to develop models that can predict the landing outcome of the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket. 
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks with their necessary outputs as well as a .pyw file for the dash application. 
The data needed to run the Jupyter Notebooks are not included in this repository, except for the folium Jupyter notebook.
However, it is possible to acquire the data using the Data Collection.ipynb and Webscraping.ipynb if so desired.
The data needed to run the dash application is included however, so if you want to try the dash application out, you can do so.

############

The following are short descriptions for the files included in this repository:

[1] Data Collection
In this notebook, we request data from the SpaceX API and perform a bit of data wrangling

[2] Webscraping
In this notebook, we use beautifulsoup to webscrape the necessary information from a Wikipedia page.

[3] Data Wrangling
In this notebook, we preprocess the data and perform necessary cleaning.

[4] SQL
In this notebook, we load a table into a database and use SQL to perform queries and gain insight on the data.

[5] Exploratory Data Analysis
In this notebook, we use EDA and data visualization to gain further understanding of the data and perform feature engineering.

[6] Folium
In this notebook, we use folium to visualize the launch sites and understand the context of the launches in a geographic scale.

[7] Dash
In this .pyw file, we create interactive dashboards for data visualization. Personally, my favorite part of the whole project.

[8] Machine Learning
In this notebook, we train and test our models to meet our objectives.

Thanks for reading and feel free to explore my work!
